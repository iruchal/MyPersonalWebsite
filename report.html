        A: Scalar Decisions is an IT solutions integrator that specializes in
        architecting, implementing and managing mission-critical IT
        environments. In relation to the field, they have a Security team, a
        Cloud team and an Infrastructure team. It is a vastly growing company,
        in fact, they are now roughly the 7th largest ICT solutions integrator
        in Canada, leaping from their 75th position back in 2007.

        >Q: What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: I set plenty of goals for myself which consisted of technical and
        practical skills. Obviously, I gained a lot of valuable technical skills
        but for me, achieving the practical goals were more satisfying. This was
        my first official job and as a beginner, I gained a lot of knowledge on
        the environment of the workplace, the culture and the attitude one
        should have during work. This can only be experienced first-hand by
        being in a working environment and going through different experiences,
        through which you learn something new every time. Coming out of the work
        term, I wanted myself to become more socially aware, outgoing,
        responsible and most importantly, have more self-control. Undoubtedly,
        the greatest thing I’ve achieved through this term is a better sense of
        self-control. The workplace teaches you to sacrifice a lot of things for
        your own benefit and you learn to prioritize tasks which not only help
        you in the workplace, but it has a positive impact on your day-to-day
        life as well. I am really thankful for this experience and I believe
        this will always be my most important and influential work term.

      <label class="animate" for="q3"
        >Q: Did you develop goals relating to your job tasks?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: When I joined the team, I was informed that there would be tasks
        which would require the knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. Right then, I
        set goals and milestones for myself to achieve throughout the work term.
        I had previous knowledge of the standard HTML and JavaScript, but
        throughout the term, I set goals like by the end of a certain month, I
        would finish learning about text effects and transitions and such.

      <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q4" />
      <label class="animate" for="q4"
        >Q: What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your
        next work experience?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: Before the start of the work term, I had a list of skills that I
        wanted to practise and master. Some of them included technical skills
        such as being fluent in HTML, JavaScript and learning about the special
        effects in web design. More importantly, I gained a lot of knowledge on
        IT tasks such as how to operate requests, process changes, create
        notifications and various different aspects of the IT and Networking
        world. The practical skills included time-management, clear
        communication, greater analysis of situations and I believe learning
        these things will help me in the future work terms. Having dealt with
        deadlines and project guidelines, these experiences will have invaluable
        importance in the future because having dealt with requirements and time
        deficit management, I will be more experienced and knowledgeable in
        similar situations which will help me deal with them in a better manner
        compared to someone who has no experience in those types of situations.
        Along with that, learning about IT and expanding my skillset will give
        me a great advantage in the future because it is a very prominent and
        common field. Having learned so much will make me more versatile and
        compatible with jobs of different requirements.

        >Q: What technologies did you want to work with and why?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: As an avid fan of the new technologies, I would have loved to
        communicate and work with some aspects of AI because to put it simply,
        it is fascinating. I don’t think I am the only one amazed and interested
        by that specific field. To actually have worked with and breaking down
        AI which is only really appreciated from the outside perspective would
        have been an unforgettable experience.

        >Q: Reflecting on your goals/learning outcomes, what goals did you
        complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and
        why?</label

      <p class="response animate">
        A: <br />
        Depth and Breadth of Understanding – Throughout my life, I’ve been
        working on my patience and putting in the effort to understand something
        during times when you get confused. There were times during my training
        phase that I wasn’t understanding some of the concepts of the ServiceNow
        modules which was quite frustrating. But I knew it had to be done so I
        was patient and gave myself multiple chances to understand the modules
        until I finally did. Sometimes, the solution is to just keep reading
        something until something clicks in your brain. I had many of those
        situations during my work term and I was able to lock down and overcome
        any obstacles to reach a deeper level of understanding.
        <br /><br />Global Understanding – My goal was to understand not only
        the aspects of my job but also to learn about my company and the bigger
        picture. Through various meetings and lunch-time events, I was able to
        grasp onto the authentic culture of my workplace and the people.
        <br /><br />Technological Literacy – I set a goal for myself to expand
        my knowledge in JavaScript and HTML. Through the tools of the tasks,
        training courses and external resources, I was able to learn a lot more
        and exercise my programming knowledge in those languages. I also wanted
        to learn Python but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get around to it.<br /><br />
        Oral Communication – I developed a lot of communication skills through
        interacting with my team and co-workers. In my set of goals, I wanted to
        really step out of my comfort zone and talk to new people. While I was
        able to build minor bonds and interact with many new people, I wasn’t
        able to build strong friendships with anyone outside my team. Firstly,
        this was down to the fact that in my workplace, the schedule is very
        flexible, and most people alternate their days due to the option of
        working from home so I wasn’t able to see the same regular people. Along
        with that, I was really the only co-op student in my area and everyone
        else had their own groups. As a result, I would just grab lunch with my
        work team or friends outside of my workplace instead of bringing my
        lunch to the work cafeteria and trying to meet new people. I am
        disappointed because I believe I could have really pushed myself to
        reach out to the people and arranged plans outside of work to bond with
        them. <br /><br />Time Management – This is something that I am really
        proud of because I believe working in a professional environment like
        this has helped me establish a structure in my lifestyle not only in the
        workplace but outside of work as well. In the beginning of this term, I
        set a goal to remove any hint of procrastination and establish a
        schedule by which I religiously follow and to the most part, it has been
        very successful. Being in a professional work environment and being
        surrounded by talented peers has motivated me to become more productive
        with my life outside of work. I have learned to sacrifice things for the
        good of my own sake and this overall experience has played an essential
        role in my new structured lifestyle.

        >Q: Give an overview of your job or project. Highlight the most
        interesting or unique aspects of your job.</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: The early stages of my job consisted of completing various training
        courses for ServiceNow and ITSM related concepts. My job mainly
        consisted of using the ServiceNow platform for IT tasks, ServiceNow
        scripting and integrating CSV files. My team received requests from
        clients to finish tasks and it was my job to complete the assigned
        tasks. I had a variety of tasks such as creating workflows and automated
        processes, UI, creating widgets, creating and manipulating records,
        creating, approving and tracking changes, and much more. In addition, I
        carried out various tests throughout the ServiceNow platform in order to
        ensure that the front-end and back-end scripting were functioning as
        they were intended to. Along with that, I would help out my team with
        side tasks such as creating documents to track the changes, bugs and
        issues.

      <p class="response animate">
        A: I want this website to not only reflect on my work term experience
        but I want this to be a portal into my world. It is a brief visual
        portfolio and I want it express how I am as a person as well. I want the
        specific design choices to express myself through the means of a web
        page.
