    <label class="animate" for="q2">Q: What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: I set plenty of goals for myself which consisted of technical and
      practical skills. Obviously, I gained a lot of valuable technical skills
      but for me, achieving the practical goals were more satisfying. This was
      my first official job and as a beginner, I gained a lot of knowledge on
      the environment of the workplace, the culture and the attitude one
      should have during work. This can only be experienced first-hand by
      being in a working environment and going through different experiences,
      through which you learn something new every time. Coming out of the work
      term, I wanted myself to become more socially aware, outgoing,
      responsible and most importantly, have more self-control. Undoubtedly,
      the greatest thing I’ve achieved through this term is a better sense of
      self-control. The workplace teaches you to sacrifice a lot of things for
      your own benefit and you learn to prioritize tasks which not only help
      you in the workplace, but it has a positive impact on your day-to-day
      life as well. I am really thankful for this experience and I believe
      this will always be my most important and influential work term.
    </p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q3" />
    <label class="animate" for="q3">Q: Did you develop goals relating to your job tasks?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: When I joined the team, I was informed that there would be tasks
      which would require the knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. Right then, I
      set goals and milestones for myself to achieve throughout the work term.
      I had previous knowledge of the standard HTML and JavaScript, but
      throughout the term, I set goals like by the end of a certain month, I
      would finish learning about text effects and transitions and such.
    </p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q4" />
    <label class="animate" for="q4">Q: What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your
      next work experience?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: Before the start of the work term, I had a list of skills that I
      wanted to practise and master. Some of them included technical skills
      such as being fluent in HTML, JavaScript and learning about the special
      effects in web design. More importantly, I gained a lot of knowledge on
      IT tasks such as how to operate requests, process changes, create
      notifications and various different aspects of the IT and Networking
      world. The practical skills included time-management, clear
      communication, greater analysis of situations and I believe learning
      these things will help me in the future work terms. Having dealt with
      deadlines and project guidelines, these experiences will have invaluable
      importance in the future because having dealt with requirements and time
      deficit management, I will be more experienced and knowledgeable in
      similar situations which will help me deal with them in a better manner
      compared to someone who has no experience in those types of situations.
      Along with that, learning about IT and expanding my skillset will give
      me a great advantage in the future because it is a very prominent and
      common field. Having learned so much will make me more versatile and
      compatible with jobs of different requirements.

    <label class="animate" for="q5">Q: What technologies did you want to work with and why?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: As an avid fan of the new technologies, I would have loved to
      communicate and work with some aspects of AI because to put it simply,
      it is fascinating. I don’t think I am the only one amazed and interested
      by that specific field. To actually have worked with and breaking down
      AI which is only really appreciated from the outside perspective would
      have been an unforgettable experience.

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q6" />
    <label class="animate" for="q6">Q: Reflecting on your goals/learning outcomes, what goals did you
      complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and
      why?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: <br />
      Depth and Breadth of Understanding – Throughout my life, I’ve been
      working on my patience and putting in the effort to understand something
      during times when you get confused. There were times during my training
      phase that I wasn’t understanding some of the concepts of the ServiceNow
      modules which was quite frustrating. But I knew it had to be done so I
      was patient and gave myself multiple chances to understand the modules
      until I finally did. Sometimes, the solution is to just keep reading
      something until something clicks in your brain. I had many of those
      situations during my work term and I was able to lock down and overcome
      any obstacles to reach a deeper level of understanding.
      <br /><br />Global Understanding – My goal was to understand not only
      the aspects of my job but also to learn about my company and the bigger
      picture. Through various meetings and lunch-time events, I was able to
      grasp onto the authentic culture of my workplace and the people.
      <br /><br />Technological Literacy – I set a goal for myself to expand
      my knowledge in JavaScript and HTML. Through the tools of the tasks,
      training courses and external resources, I was able to learn a lot more
      and exercise my programming knowledge in those languages. I also wanted
      to learn Python but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get around to it.<br /><br />
      Oral Communication – I developed a lot of communication skills through
      interacting with my team and co-workers. In my set of goals, I wanted to
      really step out of my comfort zone and talk to new people. While I was
      able to build minor bonds and interact with many new people, I wasn’t
      able to build strong friendships with anyone outside my team. Firstly,
      this was down to the fact that in my workplace, the schedule is very
      flexible, and most people alternate their days due to the option of
      working from home so I wasn’t able to see the same regular people. Along
      with that, I was really the only co-op student in my area and everyone
      else had their own groups. As a result, I would just grab lunch with my
      work team or friends outside of my workplace instead of bringing my
      lunch to the work cafeteria and trying to meet new people. I am
      disappointed because I believe I could have really pushed myself to
      reach out to the people and arranged plans outside of work to bond with
      them. <br /><br />Time Management – This is something that I am really
      proud of because I believe working in a professional environment like
      this has helped me establish a structure in my lifestyle not only in the
      workplace but outside of work as well. In the beginning of this term, I
      set a goal to remove any hint of procrastination and establish a
      schedule by which I religiously follow and to the most part, it has been
      very successful. Being in a professional work environment and being
      surrounded by talented peers has motivated me to become more productive
      with my life outside of work. I have learned to sacrifice things for the
      good of my own sake and this overall experience has played an essential
      role in my new structured lifestyle.

    <label class="animate" for="q7">Q: Give an overview of your job or project. Highlight the most
      interesting or unique aspects of your job.</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: The early stages of my job consisted of completing various training
      courses for ServiceNow and ITSM related concepts. My job mainly
      consisted of using the ServiceNow platform for IT tasks, ServiceNow
      scripting and integrating CSV files. My team received requests from
      clients to finish tasks and it was my job to complete the assigned
      tasks. I had a variety of tasks such as creating workflows and automated
      processes, UI, creating widgets, creating and manipulating records,
      creating, approving and tracking changes, and much more. In addition, I
      carried out various tests throughout the ServiceNow platform in order to
      ensure that the front-end and back-end scripting were functioning as
      they were intended to. Along with that, I would help out my team with
      side tasks such as creating documents to track the changes, bugs and
      issues.

      A: I want this website to not only reflect on my work term experience
      but I want this to be a portal into my world. It is a brief visual
      portfolio and I want it express how I am as a person as well. I want the
      specific design choices to express myself through the means of a web

    <p class="response animate">
      A: Starlight Investments is a multi-family and commercial real estate
      invest and asset management company that is focused on investment and
      active asset management of North American multi-family and commercial

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q10" />
    <label class="animate" for="q10">Q: What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: Before every work term, I like to set a lot of technical as well as
      practical goals for myself so I can improve in all areas by the end of
      the term. As a member of the Application Support team, dealing with
      tickets and requests requires technical knowledge on how to handle each
      type of case as well as problem-solving skills. Handling different types
      of tickets helped me develop knowledge on the technical side which
      consisted of using different platforms like the Yardi Voyager,
      VendorCafe, and RentCafe systems to process the user requests. As for
      the practical side, dealing with various cases and understanding the
      root cause of the issue develops problem-solving skills which is a
      universal skill that can be carried into other jobs. Another goal I set
      for myself is learning to communicate with the members of the team and
      building a rapport. Due to the unexpected circumstances of COVID-19,
      meeting in the office was not an option so we used virtual technology to
      conduct the meetings. Having daily meetings with the team which
      consisted of reporting my workload progress every day and voicing my
      experience with the cases undoubtedly helped me further develop my
      communication skills in a professional work environment. Being able to
      communicate in a professional manner and knowing how to do so is an
      essential skill that is going to be useful no matter which field or job
      ones goes to. Some other goals consisted of improving my current
      skillset of programming knowledge, getting a global understanding of my
      role and how my actions affect the company and lastly, using the
      COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to improve myself overall instead of
      letting it get the better of me and ruining my habits.
    </p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q11" />
    <label class="animate" for="q11">Q: Did you develop goals relating to your job tasks?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: Before I started this work term, I had no previous knowledge on how
      to handle support tickets and accounting based issues. The goal that I
      set for myself was to get an overall solid understanding of how the
      ticketing system works and being able to resolve the issues at hand with
      relative ease no matter the difficulty so that if I were to be employed
      in a similar job, I would have no difficulty settling in and
      understanding the process. Regarding my second goal, the core focus of
      the tickets were regarding Accounting and Financial things, and even
      though my tasks consisted of fixing issues from the front-end and did
      not have worry about that side, I wanted to learn how the actions I
      performed from my end contributed to the Accounting side of things. I
      didn’t want to blindly perform tasks from the front-end and not
      understand how it impacted the joined parts. I wanted to understand how
      the operations were performed and all the terminology used within the
      Accounting side.
    </p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q12" />
    <label class="animate" for="q12">Q: What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your
      next work experience?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: As previously mentioned, I had a big focus on improving my technical
      skills through expanding my IT and ticketing knowledge while also
      further enhancing my problem-solving abilities, a skill that is
      universal. As a member of the Application Support team, dealing with
      tickets and requests requires a lot of problem-solving skills. Handling
      different types of tickets helped me develop knowledge on the technical
      side which consisted of using different platforms like the Yardi
      Voyager, VendorCafe, and RentCafe systems to process the user requests
      through formatting and importing CSV files to reflect on the database,
      creating and granting access for the platforms as system administrator,
      and changing items and objects that lie in the current database. These
      are the general tasks that are carried out in most if not all IT based
      jobs and these skills that I have picked up on will be extremely helpful
      when transitioning into another job as I will have predeceasing
      knowledge on the core pillars of such tasks. Not to mention, the
      problem-solving skills that I have exercised and acquired during my time
      at Starlight Investments will not only help in the job field but in my
      personal life as well.

    <label class="animate" for="q13">Q: What technologies did you want to work with and why?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: Having some knowledge of IT based jobs and having worked with it
      before, ServiceNow is a very prominent and integral part of the IT field
      and is often used by many companies to operate. Expanding my knowledge
      further on ServiceNow would provide me an advantage and an it is
      regarded as a plus by many jobs if one is familiar with ServiceNow.

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q14" />
    <label class="animate" for="q14">Q: Reflecting on your goals/learning outcomes, what goals did you
      complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and
      why?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: <br />
      CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving Problem solving is a
      skill that is essential in the work environment as well as in real-life
      scenarios. It is a universal skill that applies to many different
      situations. Especially working in an environment where the core focus is
      solving different types of issues faced by the users exercises and
      develops one’s problem solving abilities further. By the end of the
      term, I wanted to be a key member of the team, having the knowledge to
      tackle the issues I was dealt, with ease. In programming, it is very
      common that an unexpected error may arise from anywhere and one has to
      be prepared to face such challenges. Having worked in an environment
      where there are constantly issues arising, I have been able to exercise
      my problem-solving skills not only in the technical aspect but in a more
      general sense as well. With every problem, one must first have a plan on
      how to tackle it which includes finding the root of the issue and
      planning on how to fix it instead of blindly going at it without any set
      plan. By dealing with tickets, I have been able to enhance that skill of
      being able to deeply problem solve which is a skill that comes handy in
      any situation presented. Of course there were some things that I wasn’t
      able to fulfill due to the circumstances such as being the one that
      executes the SQL queries for the team. Writing and running the SQL
      queries is a task that takes a lot of experience because the size of
      data that is being dealt with is much bigger than the ones in
      assignments. One tiny mistake can lead to a catastrophe so it is a role
      that is more suitable for me as I build more experience. Having said
      that, I was able to practise writing such queries in test instances and
      play around with it. Overall, I would say that working in such an
      environment has helped me gain practical skills of problem solving that
      has made me more confident and versatile, and I can take this skill to
      any job presented.

      <br /><br />PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Leadership Every job
      appreciates someone with leadership qualities, and it is something that
      one should have in their arsenal. I was very keen on leaving a good
      impression and showing initiative by taking on different types of
      tickets, such as ones that I wasn’t trained for. I constantly went on
      the team bucket of cases to see if I could help out the team in any way.
      I also got the opportunity to further show initiative when one of our
      team members departed from the team. This resulted in more cases being
      assigned to each team member and I was eager to help with the workload
      so I took it upon myself to voluntarily take on more cases.

      <br /><br />GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING - Global Understanding When doing
      anything, it is essential that one understands the purpose and how their
      work is affecting the overall picture. Working as an Application Support
      member, I took the initiative to understand how the tasks I performed
      affected the Accounting and Marketing side of things so that I wasn’t
      just blindly carrying out tasks but actually had an understanding of how
      I was contributing overall. <br /><br />
      LITERACY - Technological Literacy Before the work term started, I wanted
      to enhance my SQL skills and be more experienced and knowledgeable with
      the language. Observing how the team wrote and carried out the queries
      as well as playing around with the queries in the test instance really
      helped me get a greater understanding of queries. Despite not being
      directly involved in the query processing, this was a very valuable
      experience and I improved my understanding of queries because of it.
      <br /><br />PERSONAL LEARNING GOAL This was my biggest improvement and I
      was really proud of myself for making a change. Due to COVID-19, the
      circumstances were much different to what I expected and it brought a
      lot of negative changes to the way we live our life. I wanted to make
      sure that I use this time to better myself and not sulk on it. I wanted
      to develop habits and goals at home that I had been putting off earlier.
      The time I had in my hand had to be put to good use and I am glad to say
      I used it to my benefit. I started working out, eating healthier,
      dedicated more time to my side projects and reading, developed a good
      sleeping schedule which is something I have struggled with for a long
      time. My lifestyle has become healthier and more balanced as a result of
      working from home, an opportunity that may not have come up if COVID-19
      never happened. So, this was one of my most satisfactory goals that I
      achieved because I was able to use this time of difficulty to make a
      positive change in my life.

    <label class="animate" for="q15">Q: Give an overview of your job or project. Highlight the most
      interesting or unique aspects of your job.</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: Working in the Application Support team, my job consisted of
      resolving tickets and fulfilling requests raised by different teams,
      whether it came from Starlight itself or other partnering companies. In
      order to fulfill the requests, the main platforms at use were Yardi
      Voyager, VendorCafe, and RentCafe. The general overview of the tickets
      involved setting up users, providing user role, post-month and property
      access, formatting CSV files and uploading them to the database as ETLs,
      creating items on the platform such as parking spots, amenities, unit
      types, etc. Having said that, there was a lot of unique tickets which
      required extra knowledge and needed more steps to be followed. The
      overall providing user access and uploading items to the database was
      done in Yardi Voyager. In terms of fulfilling requests for the vendors,
      VendorCafe was used and some aspects of setting up tenants and corporate
      users were performed in RentCafe. The interesting part about my job was
      I got to see how the accounting and financing side merges with the
      computing and IT side of things. Having taken accounting last semester,
      I got to see a lot of the principles and terms being used in real, work
      environments and how they are applied. It was very interesting to see
      how the three platforms mentioned above were synced and how an action on
      one of them could reflect on the other two.

      Despite the core of the company not being based around technology, there are various computing technologies used
      within the
      different areas of the company. There are various teams such as the Development team, Automation team, QA team,
      etc.
      which utilise the computer science technology in their daily work. The hard workers in the team reflect the
      current
      excellent standings of the company with Co-operators being a leading Canadian multi-line insurance and financial
      services with $47.3 billion in assets. As a student living in Guelph, I always used to see the Co-operators
      building,
      located in the heart of downtown Guelph and it is a great pleasure to now be working with them.

    <label class="animate" for="q17">Q: What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: There were many goals that I had set for my time at the Co-operators, especially as it is my last co-op
      placement
      in my 5 year program. These goals are more concentrated on the soft skills aspect. My goals were as follows:

      Communication – As a developer in the modern age, it is now not only our job to be able to code well but also to
      speak
      well. Being able to communicate with the team, stakeholders, executives is an essential skill in the industry and
      many
      companies look for these skills in their candidates. I really wanted to hone in on my communication skills so I
      can
      prepare for the work industry. I challenged myself to organize meetings with team members when in need of help and
      not
      shy away from doing so. Also, I wanted to talk to various members of the team and build connections for the future
      as
      that is extremely important for your career. Another small goal I had was to present my work to my team members at
      least
      once so that I have the experience of talking in front of a team and being able to showcase my work, explaining
      the
      process and thinking behind it.
      Teamwork – Working in a team is something that one must get used to if they plan on working as a developer. I
      wanted
      to
      use this work term as an opportunity to enhance my teamwork skills. I set small goals for myself such as helping
      new
      people settling in and answering any questions they might have, reaching out and asking other team members if they
      require any assistance, doing my part for the team by ensuring that I finish my tasks in the given time and
      producing
      high quality work. Also, I challenged myself to step in and help with the workload of the team in times when a
      team
      member might be away.
      Time Management – The skill of time management can help not only in the work field but in the daily aspect of our
      lives
      as well. This was another skill that I wanted to really improve on. Before I took on the role of being an
      Automation
      Developer for the team, I knew I would have to manage working on different projects at the same time. So I set
      myself a
      goal to manage my time efficiently and allocate a set amount of time for each project. It is important to not get
      caught
      up in one thing and forget about the other tasks that you are responsible for. So being able to manage different
      tasks,
      knowing how much time to allocate for each task and keeping track of the progress is an essential skill that I
      challenged myself to learn and enhance.

      Global Understanding – It is important to make the most out of every job opportunity by making sure you’ve
      squeezed
      out
      every bit of knowledge you could absorb. Working in an insurance company such as this, I wanted to understand how
      everything works. The process of making a claim, registering a vehicle, creating the policy ,etc. Understanding
      these
      things can help me greatly if I work for another insurance company in the future.

    <label class="animate" for="q18">Q: Did you develop goals relating to your job tasks?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: Having relatively minimal experience with automation prior to taking this job, I set a few technical learning
      goals for
      myself. Firstly, I wanted to make sure that I write my own test suite for the automation. I challenged myself to
      not
      only understand the full picture of automation but to use that knowledge to create my own test suite. Through
      this,
      I
      could take this knowledge into my own projects and write my own test scripts for it. Another technical learning
      goal
      I
      set for myself was to expand my knowledge of the front-end and more specifically, the back-end. Although the
      automation
      is solely based on the front-end, I wanted to learn some more things and expand my knowledge on the back-end. I
      wanted
      to see the various tools and programs that were in place and how the back-end was structured. I challenged myself
      to
      use
      this opportunity to take a look at the large-scale projects and the frameworks, code standards, structures are
      established for a back-end especially since these projects are much bigger than any typical personal or school
      projects.
      Exploring and delving into such large-scale projects can provide great insight and knowledge on how the various
      aspects
      of programming we’ve learned are applied to the real industry development projects.

    <label class="animate" for="q19">Q: What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your
      next work experience?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: To get into the specifics of the skills I wanted to learn, there were a few I had my eyes set on. Firstly, I
      wanted to
      get a deep understanding of the Robot Automation Framework. It is used by many companies for their automation
      needs
      and
      knowing that automation jobs are in such high demand, knowing how to use it can present a great advantage. Along
      with
      that, I wanted to enhance my literacy with Python as well. Python is one of the highest demanded programming
      languages
      and I wanted to challenge myself by trying to expand on my current knowledge by incorporating it in the projects.
      I
      also
      wanted to work more with JavaScript, specifically focusing on Ajax calls. Ajax calls are very frequently used in
      building the back-end of the website so I wanted to get more experience with that. This can be very helpful on
      your
      resume, especially when taking on web development jobs.
    </p>
    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q20" />
    <label class="animate" for="q20">Q: What technologies did you want to work with and why?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: I wanted to work with JavaScript and Python primarily as these two languages are arguably the most in demand
      right now.
      This included any tools or programs that utilised these languages as they will help with my resume and skillset.
    </p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q21" />
    <label class="animate" for="q21">Q: Reflecting on your goals/learning outcomes, what goals did you
      complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and
      why?</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: Before my time at the Co-operators, I set goals for myself in hopes of bettering my skillset and coming out as
      a more
      knowledgeable, experienced and improved version of myself. Working at the Co-operators has allowed me to do so by
      offering me various opportunities to showcase my skills and prove my worth. This is my reflection on the goals
      that I
      had set for myself:<br /><br />
      Communication – I wanted to come out of the work-term at the Co-operators with a more sociable, approachable and
      talk-experienced version of myself. And I believe for the most part, I have achieved that. Whenever I needed any
      help or
      had a question about something, I scheduled meetings with my team members to discuss it and clear it up. I also
      wanted
      to put myself about more, talking to more people and building connections and I believe I have achieved that.
      During
      team events or meetings, I tried to talk to the people about their past experiences and asked for their tips on
      how to
      succeed, achieve goals, and become a more efficient version of myself. I also presented my work to my team members
      as
      well which helped me gain more confidence with showcasing my work in the future. I believe that something I could
      have
      improved on was showcasing my work more frequently and not shying away from the spotlight. I could have also
      volunteered
      to lead meetings when other team members were away. These are all goals that I can set for myself in the future
      and look
      to improve on.

      <br /><br />Teamwork – I made a conscious effort to put myself about and try to help my team members when in need
      so I am happy with
      the progress that I have made. When there were any team members that were confused about something or needed help,
      I
      tried to set meetings with them to discuss and do my part by helping them understand it better. I would like to
      challenge myself further by stepping in more frequently when a team member is away by taking some work off their
      load,
      helping the team.

      <br /><br />Time Management – After my first couple of months, I was assigned more projects so I had to learn to
      manage my time and
      ensure that each project had the right amount of time dedicated to it. Being in charge of the Daily Shakedown
      Script
      which was a test suite that runs every morning, I had to learn to dedicate my morning time to that. Once
      everything was
      checked and any necessary changes were made, I would then work on writing test cases for the Regression project I
      was
      working on. This helped me get some great experience under my belt. Although I am sure there will be even more
      work
      assigned to me at once that I would have to balance once I work in a full time position, this will help me prepare
      for
      those situations and help me allocate time to each task efficiently. <br /><br />
      Global Understanding – Writing various test cases for the different processes involved in an insurance company
      such as
      making a claim, payment, policy etc. helped me get a good understanding of how the processes work. I also got a
      brief
      training course on the workflow of the processes in the beginning of my work term which provided me a clear view
      of the
      greater picture. I not only learned about the processes but also got the technical insight on how they were
      structured.
      For instance, I got to see how the client information and policy details would be stored in the back-end. Now, If
      I work
      for an insurance company in the future, I will already have pre-existing knowledge on the processes and
      technological
      aspects of it as well, providing me an advantage in the job search.

    <label class="animate" for="q22">Q: Give an overview of your job or project. Highlight the most
      interesting or unique aspects of your job.</label>
    <p class="response animate">
      A: I joined the Co-operators as an Automation developer who had minimal experience with automation and testing. I
      had a few
      projects in school that required testing but it was done at a very high-level. Working at the Co-operators, I got
      to
      learn the low-level details of testing and how it is automated. I picked up many valuable skills here that I can
      take
      anywhere and utilise. My primary job was to ensure that the Daily Shakedown Script was passing all the test cases
      and to
      make any necessary changes when it failed as well as writing new test cases for the script. To put it simply, the
      Daily
      Shakedown Script is a collection of test cases which test the various components of the company’s website for the
      clients, ensuring that the user is able to perform necessary tasks such as making a payment, making a claim, being
      able
      to access the “Contact Us” page, checking their profile, etc. This script runs every morning at the same time and
      releases a report after completion specifying the percentage of the pass rate for the test cases. My main priority
      was
      to have the pass rate at 100% consistently and write new test cases that the script didn’t currently cover. Along
      with
      that, I worked on the Regression Test project where I wrote test cases for different modules of the website. This
      project focused on intensively testing specific modules of the website. For instance, one of the modules for that
      project was the “Make A Payment” module where I wrote multiple test cases with different values to make sure it
      would
      give the right error or message. Both of these projects required the same tools. When writing the test cases and
      automating, the two main tools I used were the Robot Framework and Selenium. Robot Framework is a generic test
      automation framework for test-driven development and the Selenium library is a web testing library for the Robot
      Framework. I used the PyCharm IDE to write all the test cases as it is specifically for the Python Language which
      is the
      language in which the test cases are written. I gained invaluable experience working with automation, writing test
      cases
      using object identification, and I am very thankful. This experience will help me massively in the future,
      especially
      for any automation roles.
