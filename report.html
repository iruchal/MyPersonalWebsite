        >Q: What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: I set plenty of goals for myself which consisted of technical and
        practical skills. Obviously, I gained a lot of valuable technical skills
        but for me, achieving the practical goals were more satisfying. This was
        my first official job and as a beginner, I gained a lot of knowledge on
        the environment of the workplace, the culture and the attitude one
        should have during work. This can only be experienced first-hand by
        being in a working environment and going through different experiences,
        through which you learn something new every time. Coming out of the work
        term, I wanted myself to become more socially aware, outgoing,
        responsible and most importantly, have more self-control. Undoubtedly,
        the greatest thing I’ve achieved through this term is a better sense of
        self-control. The workplace teaches you to sacrifice a lot of things for
        your own benefit and you learn to prioritize tasks which not only help
        you in the workplace, but it has a positive impact on your day-to-day
        life as well. I am really thankful for this experience and I believe
        this will always be my most important and influential work term.

        >Q: Did you develop goals relating to your job tasks?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: When I joined the team, I was informed that there would be tasks
        which would require the knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. Right then, I
        set goals and milestones for myself to achieve throughout the work term.
        I had previous knowledge of the standard HTML and JavaScript, but
        throughout the term, I set goals like by the end of a certain month, I
        would finish learning about text effects and transitions and such.

        >Q: What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your
        next work experience?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: Before the start of the work term, I had a list of skills that I
        wanted to practise and master. Some of them included technical skills
        such as being fluent in HTML, JavaScript and learning about the special
        effects in web design. More importantly, I gained a lot of knowledge on
        IT tasks such as how to operate requests, process changes, create
        notifications and various different aspects of the IT and Networking
        world. The practical skills included time-management, clear
        communication, greater analysis of situations and I believe learning
        these things will help me in the future work terms. Having dealt with
        deadlines and project guidelines, these experiences will have invaluable
        importance in the future because having dealt with requirements and time
        deficit management, I will be more experienced and knowledgeable in
        similar situations which will help me deal with them in a better manner
        compared to someone who has no experience in those types of situations.
        Along with that, learning about IT and expanding my skillset will give
        me a great advantage in the future because it is a very prominent and
        common field. Having learned so much will make me more versatile and
        compatible with jobs of different requirements.

      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: As an avid fan of the new technologies, I would have loved to
        communicate and work with some aspects of AI because to put it simply,
        it is fascinating. I don’t think I am the only one amazed and interested
        by that specific field. To actually have worked with and breaking down
        AI which is only really appreciated from the outside perspective would
        have been an unforgettable experience.

        >Q: Reflecting on your goals/learning outcomes, what goals did you
        complete? What goals were you not successful in completing and
        why?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: <br />
        Depth and Breadth of Understanding – Throughout my life, I’ve been
        working on my patience and putting in the effort to understand something
        during times when you get confused. There were times during my training
        phase that I wasn’t understanding some of the concepts of the ServiceNow
        modules which was quite frustrating. But I knew it had to be done so I
        was patient and gave myself multiple chances to understand the modules
        until I finally did. Sometimes, the solution is to just keep reading
        something until something clicks in your brain. I had many of those
        situations during my work term and I was able to lock down and overcome
        any obstacles to reach a deeper level of understanding.
        <br /><br />Global Understanding – My goal was to understand not only
        the aspects of my job but also to learn about my company and the bigger
        picture. Through various meetings and lunch-time events, I was able to
        grasp onto the authentic culture of my workplace and the people.
        <br /><br />Technological Literacy – I set a goal for myself to expand
        my knowledge in JavaScript and HTML. Through the tools of the tasks,
        training courses and external resources, I was able to learn a lot more
        and exercise my programming knowledge in those languages. I also wanted
        to learn Python but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get around to it.<br /><br />
        Oral Communication – I developed a lot of communication skills through
        interacting with my team and co-workers. In my set of goals, I wanted to
        really step out of my comfort zone and talk to new people. While I was
        able to build minor bonds and interact with many new people, I wasn’t
        able to build strong friendships with anyone outside my team. Firstly,
        this was down to the fact that in my workplace, the schedule is very
        flexible, and most people alternate their days due to the option of
        working from home so I wasn’t able to see the same regular people. Along
        with that, I was really the only co-op student in my area and everyone
        else had their own groups. As a result, I would just grab lunch with my
        work team or friends outside of my workplace instead of bringing my
        lunch to the work cafeteria and trying to meet new people. I am
        disappointed because I believe I could have really pushed myself to
        reach out to the people and arranged plans outside of work to bond with
        them. <br /><br />Time Management – This is something that I am really
        proud of because I believe working in a professional environment like
        this has helped me establish a structure in my lifestyle not only in the
        workplace but outside of work as well. In the beginning of this term, I
        set a goal to remove any hint of procrastination and establish a
        schedule by which I religiously follow and to the most part, it has been
        very successful. Being in a professional work environment and being
        surrounded by talented peers has motivated me to become more productive
        with my life outside of work. I have learned to sacrifice things for the
        good of my own sake and this overall experience has played an essential
        role in my new structured lifestyle.

        interesting or unique aspects of your job.</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: The early stages of my job consisted of completing various training
        courses for ServiceNow and ITSM related concepts. My job mainly
        consisted of using the ServiceNow platform for IT tasks, ServiceNow
        scripting and integrating CSV files. My team received requests from
        clients to finish tasks and it was my job to complete the assigned
        tasks. I had a variety of tasks such as creating workflows and automated
        processes, UI, creating widgets, creating and manipulating records,
        creating, approving and tracking changes, and much more. In addition, I
        carried out various tests throughout the ServiceNow platform in order to
        ensure that the front-end and back-end scripting were functioning as
        they were intended to. Along with that, I would help out my team with
        side tasks such as creating documents to track the changes, bugs and
        issues.

        A: I want this website to not only reflect on my work term experience
        but I want this to be a portal into my world. It is a brief visual
        portfolio and I want it express how I am as a person as well. I want the
        specific design choices to express myself through the means of a web
        page.

        >Q: What were your goals/learning outcomes for this work term?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: Before every work term, I like to set a lot of technical as well as
        practical goals for myself so I can improve in all areas by the end of
        the term. As a member of the Application Support team, dealing with
        tickets and requests requires technical knowledge on how to handle each
        type of case as well as problem-solving skills. Handling different types
        of tickets helped me develop knowledge on the technical side which
        consisted of using different platforms like the Yardi Voyager,
        VendorCafe, and RentCafe systems to process the user requests. As for
        the practical side, dealing with various cases and understanding the
        root cause of the issue develops problem-solving skills which is a
        universal skill that can be carried into other jobs. Another goal I set
        for myself is learning to communicate with the members of the team and
        building a rapport. Due to the unexpected circumstances of COVID-19,
        meeting in the office was not an option so we used virtual technology to
        conduct the meetings. Having daily meetings with the team which
        consisted of reporting my workload progress every day and voicing my
        experience with the cases undoubtedly helped me further develop my
        communication skills in a professional work environment. Being able to
        communicate in a professional manner and knowing how to do so is an
        essential skill that is going to be useful no matter which field or job
        ones goes to. Some other goals consisted of improving my current
        skillset of programming knowledge, getting a global understanding of my
        role and how my actions affect the company and lastly, using the
        COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to improve myself overall instead of
        letting it get the better of me and ruining my habits.

      <label class="animate" for="q11"
        >Q: Did you develop goals relating to your job tasks?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: Before I started this work term, I had no previous knowledge on how
        to handle support tickets and accounting based issues. The goal that I
        set for myself was to get an overall solid understanding of how the
        ticketing system works and being able to resolve the issues at hand with
        relative ease no matter the difficulty so that if I were to be employed
        in a similar job, I would have no difficulty settling in and
        understanding the process. Regarding my second goal, the core focus of
        the tickets were regarding Accounting and Financial things, and even
        though my tasks consisted of fixing issues from the front-end and did
        not have worry about that side, I wanted to learn how the actions I
        performed from my end contributed to the Accounting side of things. I
        didn’t want to blindly perform tasks from the front-end and not
        understand how it impacted the joined parts. I wanted to understand how
        the operations were performed and all the terminology used within the
        Accounting side.

        next work experience?</label
      >
      <p class="response animate">
        A: As previously mentioned, I had a big focus on improving my technical
        skills through expanding my IT and ticketing knowledge while also
        further enhancing my problem-solving abilities, a skill that is
        universal. As a member of the Application Support team, dealing with
        tickets and requests requires a lot of problem-solving skills. Handling
        different types of tickets helped me develop knowledge on the technical
        side which consisted of using different platforms like the Yardi
        Voyager, VendorCafe, and RentCafe systems to process the user requests
        through formatting and importing CSV files to reflect on the database,
        creating and granting access for the platforms as system administrator,
        and changing items and objects that lie in the current database. These
        are the general tasks that are carried out in most if not all IT based
        jobs and these skills that I have picked up on will be extremely helpful
        when transitioning into another job as I will have predeceasing
        knowledge on the core pillars of such tasks. Not to mention, the
        problem-solving skills that I have exercised and acquired during my time
        at Starlight Investments will not only help in the job field but in my
        personal life as well.

        before, ServiceNow is a very prominent and integral part of the IT field
        and is often used by many companies to operate. Expanding my knowledge
        further on ServiceNow would provide me an advantage and an it is
        regarded as a plus by many jobs if one is familiar with ServiceNow.

        why?</label

      <p class="response animate">
        A: <br />
        CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving Problem solving is a
        skill that is essential in the work environment as well as in real-life
        scenarios. It is a universal skill that applies to many different
        situations. Especially working in an environment where the core focus is
        solving different types of issues faced by the users exercises and
        develops one’s problem solving abilities further. By the end of the
        term, I wanted to be a key member of the team, having the knowledge to
        tackle the issues I was dealt, with ease. In programming, it is very
        common that an unexpected error may arise from anywhere and one has to
        be prepared to face such challenges. Having worked in an environment
        where there are constantly issues arising, I have been able to exercise
        my problem-solving skills not only in the technical aspect but in a more
        general sense as well. With every problem, one must first have a plan on
        how to tackle it which includes finding the root of the issue and
        planning on how to fix it instead of blindly going at it without any set
        plan. By dealing with tickets, I have been able to enhance that skill of
        being able to deeply problem solve which is a skill that comes handy in
        any situation presented. Of course there were some things that I wasn’t
        able to fulfill due to the circumstances such as being the one that
        executes the SQL queries for the team. Writing and running the SQL
        queries is a task that takes a lot of experience because the size of
        data that is being dealt with is much bigger than the ones in
        assignments. One tiny mistake can lead to a catastrophe so it is a role
        that is more suitable for me as I build more experience. Having said
        that, I was able to practise writing such queries in test instances and
        play around with it. Overall, I would say that working in such an
        environment has helped me gain practical skills of problem solving that
        has made me more confident and versatile, and I can take this skill to
        any job presented.

        <br /><br />PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Leadership Every job
        appreciates someone with leadership qualities, and it is something that
        one should have in their arsenal. I was very keen on leaving a good
        impression and showing initiative by taking on different types of
        tickets, such as ones that I wasn’t trained for. I constantly went on
        the team bucket of cases to see if I could help out the team in any way.
        I also got the opportunity to further show initiative when one of our
        team members departed from the team. This resulted in more cases being
        assigned to each team member and I was eager to help with the workload
        so I took it upon myself to voluntarily take on more cases.

        <br /><br />GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING - Global Understanding When doing
        anything, it is essential that one understands the purpose and how their
        work is affecting the overall picture. Working as an Application Support
        member, I took the initiative to understand how the tasks I performed
        affected the Accounting and Marketing side of things so that I wasn’t
        just blindly carrying out tasks but actually had an understanding of how
        I was contributing overall. <br /><br />
        LITERACY - Technological Literacy Before the work term started, I wanted
        to enhance my SQL skills and be more experienced and knowledgeable with
        the language. Observing how the team wrote and carried out the queries
        as well as playing around with the queries in the test instance really
        helped me get a greater understanding of queries. Despite not being
        directly involved in the query processing, this was a very valuable
        experience and I improved my understanding of queries because of it.
        <br /><br />PERSONAL LEARNING GOAL This was my biggest improvement and I
        was really proud of myself for making a change. Due to COVID-19, the
        circumstances were much different to what I expected and it brought a
        lot of negative changes to the way we live our life. I wanted to make
        sure that I use this time to better myself and not sulk on it. I wanted
        to develop habits and goals at home that I had been putting off earlier.
        The time I had in my hand had to be put to good use and I am glad to say
        I used it to my benefit. I started working out, eating healthier,
        dedicated more time to my side projects and reading, developed a good
        sleeping schedule which is something I have struggled with for a long
        time. My lifestyle has become healthier and more balanced as a result of
        working from home, an opportunity that may not have come up if COVID-19
        never happened. So, this was one of my most satisfactory goals that I
        achieved because I was able to use this time of difficulty to make a
        positive change in my life.

        A: Working in the Application Support team, my job consisted of
        resolving tickets and fulfilling requests raised by different teams,
        whether it came from Starlight itself or other partnering companies. In
        order to fulfill the requests, the main platforms at use were Yardi
        Voyager, VendorCafe, and RentCafe. The general overview of the tickets
        involved setting up users, providing user role, post-month and property
        access, formatting CSV files and uploading them to the database as ETLs,
        creating items on the platform such as parking spots, amenities, unit
        types, etc. Having said that, there was a lot of unique tickets which
        required extra knowledge and needed more steps to be followed. The
        overall providing user access and uploading items to the database was
        done in Yardi Voyager. In terms of fulfilling requests for the vendors,
        VendorCafe was used and some aspects of setting up tenants and corporate
        users were performed in RentCafe. The interesting part about my job was
        I got to see how the accounting and financing side merges with the
        computing and IT side of things. Having taken accounting last semester,
        I got to see a lot of the principles and terms being used in real, work
        environments and how they are applied. It was very interesting to see
        how the three platforms mentioned above were synced and how an action on
        one of them could reflect on the other two.
